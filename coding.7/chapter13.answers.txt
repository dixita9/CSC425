Question 2. Now, run free, perhaps using some of the arguments that might
 be useful (e.g., -m, to display memory totals in megabytes).
 How much memory is in your system? How much is free? Do these numbers match
 your intuition?

Answer: After running the command "free -mù, the output states that my system 
has 7960 total memory and 6907 is free.Yes, the numbers match my intuition. 

Question 4. Now, while running your memory-user program, also (in a different terminal window, but on the same machine) run the free
tool. How do the memory usage totals change when your program
is running? How about when you kill the memory-user program?
Do the numbers match your expectations? Try this for different
amounts of memory usage. What happens when you use really
large amounts of memory?
 
Answer:The memory usage totals are increased by the amount I allocated in the parameter while running the memory user
program. For example, if I ran the memoray user program with 2000 memory, the memory usage shown by "free" program also 
goes up. 
When we kill the memory user
